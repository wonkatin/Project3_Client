1. React framework (manipulate the DOM based on application data and response to user interaction)
2. Express.js, Node.js (manage routes, handling requests and views)
3. Mongoose (create all necessary for project models)
4. MongoDB (save and store users: authorization info, trips, expenses, checklists etc)
5. Bcrypt, Json web token (take care of security)
6. Axios (pull up backend and APIâ€™s data)
7. Dotenv package (hide/ store secret important information)
8. Rowdy-logger (help to visualize routes)

APIs:
